We are creating an Android messaging application that uses Bluetooth to connect to local devices.

Over the course of our Grade 12 semester, we will create a working application suitable for use on multiple Android devices.  We will be coding in Android Studio.

We have chosen to use Bluetooth to make our application unique and independent of Wi-Fi and cellular reception.  Our application will enable users to communicate within a localized area.  By using Bluetooth we hope to create conversation among peers.
